# Trackable electric Longboard
This is a project made in the first year of my studies MCT. We needed to make an IoT device (containing a Raspberry Pi) with a responsive website, provided with at least one sensor and a database storage.

I chose to make an electric longboard with an interface where you can view your traveled routes on a map, along with other information such as the average speed of your route, total distanceâ€¦
You can also start/stop tracking a route and check the location of your board. 
The longboard is provided with a touch screen, where you also can start/stop tracking your route and control the front and rear lights.

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi
- Adafruit GPS tracker
- Touch screen
- ESC
- RC remote
- lipo batteries
- Front and rear light
- ...

## Technologies
- Flask - Micro web framework
- Google maps API - Display routes
